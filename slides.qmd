## Abstract

Evidence on street networks and their potential changes under future scenarios is crucial for active travel planning.
However, most active travel models rely on oversimplified street representations, using single variables like 'quietness', neglecting key factors such as footway widths.
This paper introduces new methods for classifying street networks for active travel, integrating diverse datasets from OpenStreetMap and official sources.
Implemented in open source software packages `osmactive` and `anime`, these methods are scalable and reproducible.
The results are showcased in a web application hosted at www.npt.scot, demonstrating how geographic data science can drive high-impact research.

## Active travel and street networks

-   Active travel is an accessible and cost-effective way to replace short car trips and make transport systems more sustainable.
-   Most active travel models rely on oversimplified street representations, neglecting key factors such as footway widths.
-   Need for new methods for classifying street networks for active travel, integrating diverse datasets. -->

# Datasets and methods

## Datasets

-   [**Ordnance Survey OpenRoads**]{style="color:darkblue;"}
-   [**OS MasterMap Highways**]{style="color:darkblue;"}
-   [**OS Mastermap Topography**]{style="color:darkblue;"}
-   [**OpenStreetMap**]{style="color:darkblue;"}
-   NRS (National Records of Scotland) data on travel to school
-   NRS data on travel to work (Data Zone level)
-   Scottish Household Survey (SHS) data
-   National Travel Survey (NTS) data
-   Data from spatial interaction models (SIMs)

## Software

Code is available and maintained at [github.com/nptscot](https://github.com/nptscot)

-   Backend written in R

-   Frontend of NPT web application written in 'vanilla' JavaScript

-   NPW (Network Planning Workspace) web application written in Rust and Svelte

-   See [nptscot.github.io/npw](https://nptscot.github.io/npw/)

-   `mastermapr` R package for importing MasterMap datasets

-   `osmactive` R package for classifying OSM data

-   `anime` Rust crate for network integration

## Key functions

-   Functions including `get_travel_network()` and `classify_cycle_infrastructure()` from the `osmactive` package.
-   Classify cycle infrastructure types based on the presence of cycle lanes, tracks, and other features.
-   `distance_to_road()` function to calculate distances to roads.
-   `get_pavement_widths()` function to calculate pavement widths

## Live demo: getting active travel network data

```{r}
#| include: false
#| eval: false
library(dplyr)
library(osmactive)
library(tmap)
```

```{r}
#| label: bristol
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
remotes::install_github("nptscot/osmactive")
library(osmactive)
osm = get_travel_network("bristol")
cycle_net = get_cycling_network(osm)
drive_net = get_driving_network(osm)
cycle_net = distance_to_road(cycle_net, drive_net)
cycle_net = classify_cycle_infrastructure(cycle_net)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
sf::write_sf(cycle_net, "cycle_network.geojson", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

```{r}
cycle_net = sf::read_sf("cycle_network.geojson")
```

```{r}
#| label: plot
#| eval: false
plot_osm_tmap(cycle_net)
```

## Integration with Geocomputation with R stack

```{r}
#| echo: true
tmap::tmap_mode("view")
plot_osm_tmap(cycle_net)
```

## Road width measurements

-   Carriageway width and corridor width are key measurements.
-   Carriageway width determines if infrastructure can fit within the carriageway.
-   Corridor width captures carriageway plus roadside features.
-   `get_pavement_widths()` function in `osmactive` package.

## Minimum cycle track and buffer widths

-   Corridor width determines if footway can be reallocated for cycle infrastructure.
-   Cycling by Design (CbD) guidance on widths and buffers.
-   Speed limit data from OSM used for buffer widths.

## Bus routes and road traffic assumptions

-   Minimum space requirements for motor traffic depend on bus routes and lanes.
-   Active Travel England cross section check tool.
-   `get_bus_routes()` function in `osmactive` package.

# Results
