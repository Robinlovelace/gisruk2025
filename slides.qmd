# Overview of GISRUK 2025 Presentation

## Title

Mapping, classifying, and integrating diverse street network datasets: new methods and open source tools for active travel planning

## Abstract

Evidence on street networks and their potential changes under future scenarios is crucial for active travel planning. However, most active travel models rely on oversimplified street representations, using single variables like 'quietness', neglecting key factors such as footway widths. This paper introduces new methods for classifying street networks for active travel, integrating diverse datasets from OpenStreetMap and official sources. Implemented in open source software packages `osmactive` and `anime`, these methods are scalable and reproducible. The results are showcased in a web application hosted at www.npt.scot, demonstrating how geographic data science can drive high-impact research.

## Keywords

# Introduction

## Active travel and street networks

- Active travel is an accessible and cost-effective way to replace short car trips and make transport systems more sustainable.
- Most active travel models rely on oversimplified street representations, neglecting key factors such as footway widths.
- Need for new methods for classifying street networks for active travel, integrating diverse datasets.

## Network Planning Tool (NPT) for Scotland

- New web-based strategic network planning tool that estimates cycling potential down to the street level.
- Builds on the functionality of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) and related tools.
- Funded by Transport Scotland and developed by the University of Leeds in collaboration with Sustrans Scotland.
- Open-source and hosted at [github.come/nptscot](https://github.com/nptscot).

## Key features of NPT

- Integration of multiple layers into a single tool.
- Overcoming limitations of previous strategic network planning tools.
- Brings together more than a dozen datasets, including Ordnance Survey Mastermap and OpenStreetmap data products.
- Presents new geographic methods developed to support this work.
- Uses `osmactive` R package and `anime` Rust crate.

# Datasets and methods

## Datasets

- Ordnance Survey OpenRoads
- OS MasterMap Highways
- OS Mastermap Topography
- OpenStreetMap

## Methods

- `mastermapr` R package for importing MasterMap datasets
- `osmactive` R package for classifying OSM data
- `anime` Rust crate for network integration
- `get_pavement_widths()` function to calculate pavement widths
- `get_bus_routes()` function to determine bus lanes
- `classify_cycle_infrastructure()` function to classify cycle infrastructure

## Classifying OpenStreetNetwork ways

- Functions including `get_travel_network()` and `classify_cycle_infrastructure()` from the `osmactive` package.
- Classify cycle infrastructure types based on the presence of cycle lanes, tracks, and other features.

## Road width measurements

- Carriageway width and corridor width are key measurements.
- Carriageway width determines if infrastructure can fit within the carriageway.
- Corridor width captures carriageway plus roadside features.
- `get_pavement_widths()` function in `osmactive` package.

## Minimum cycle track and buffer widths

- Corridor width determines if footway can be reallocated for cycle infrastructure.
- Cycling by Design (CbD) guidance on widths and buffers.
- Speed limit data from OSM used for buffer widths.

## Bus routes and road traffic assumptions

- Minimum space requirements for motor traffic depend on bus routes and lanes.
- Active Travel England cross section check tool.
- `get_bus_routes()` function in `osmactive` package.

# Results

## Network Planning Tool for Scotland

- Web application for strategic cycle network planning.
- Key components:
    - Route network layer
    - Infrastructure and traffic layer
    - Street space layer
    - Core network layer
    - Network Planning Workspace (NPW) web application ([https://nptscot.github.io/npw/](https://nptscot.github.io/npw/))

## Street space layer

- Categorises roads in accordance with Cycling by Design guidance.
- Methodology for classifying road spaces and cycle infrastructure.

## Conclusion

- NPT is a cutting-edge web application for strategic cycle network planning.
- Unique feature: integration of multiple layers.
- New street space layer: step change in access to combined carriageway and corridor widths.

## Future work

- Improve NPT by incorporating new datasets.
- Develop context-specific classifications in `osmactive` package.
- Support roll-out of methods in new places.
